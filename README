rv.el - a toy RISC-V emulator for Emacs

Aiming RV64GC emulation with ELF executables.

It is incomplete, but capable of running simple statically linked
Linux programs that use a few common syscalls, without heavy use of
floating-point numbers (the implementation of which is particularly
incomplete). dash was used to try it out during the development.

Memory-mapped I/O can be added.
